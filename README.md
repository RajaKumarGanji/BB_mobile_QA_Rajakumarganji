## Deliverables:
1. Create a series of testcases based on the application functionality. Make sure that you give detailed instructions for each test case (step preconditions, steps to execute test case, expected results, etc). You can use any format you prefer.(GULBERK's COMMENT: Please see TestResultsExcel.xlsx file under Reports folder https://github.com/gulberkdemir/BB-Mobile-QA-assignment-Gulberk/tree/master/Reports)
2. Automate at least 5 (the more, the better!) of the previously created test cases. Use of Espresso as an automation tool is highly preferred. As an alternative you can use UI Automator. No other tool is accepted.(GULBERK's COMMENT: You can look through my GitHub project that I shared with you)
3. Provide a clear set of instructions how to run tests. (GULBERK's COMMENT: Please look at above first six items in README.md file )
4. Provide a test report for executed test cases (manual and automated) (GULBERK's COMMENT: Please see Test Results - Tests_in_'app_com_mobileassignment_views'.html and TestResultsExcel.xlsx under Reports folder https://github.com/gulberkdemir/BB-Mobile-QA-assignment-Gulberk/tree/master/Reports)
5. In the case of finding bugs, provide a separate bug report (GULBERK's COMMENT: Please see BugReport.xlsx file which is under \BB-Mobile-QA-assignment-Gulberk\Reports)
6. Provide an overall evaluation test report for the application (issues, risks, recommendation, etc.). Make it personal! Explain why you decided to automate what you’ve automated, why you decided to test what you’ve tested, what test strategies you decided to use and why... Summarising, guide us through your mind! (GULBERK's COMMENT:Please have a look at I-Evaluation field in the TestResultsExcel.xlsx under Reports folder https://github.com/gulberkdemir/BB-Mobile-QA-assignment-Gulberk/tree/master/Reports)
